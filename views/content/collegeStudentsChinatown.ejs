							<h1>College Students Growing Up in Chinatown</h1>

								<p>
                                <br>
								Growing up in Chinatown has been an important part of the lives of both college students who are American Born Chinese (ABCs) and immigrants from China. Students who grew up in Chinatown feel connected through the community in Chinatown as a whole due to the shared cultural beliefs and practices most Chinese people practice. College students who grew up in Chinatown usually went to an elementary school that was close to Chinatown due to the walkability.  
								<br> <br />
								According to James Tan, a second year college student who grew up in Chinatown: <br>
                                “Outside of Haines, growing up in Chinatown was a big thing because I used to live in a house across that school, and I would know a lot of people in that community by walking and going out to markets to buy food. I would meet a lot of people and it made me feel like part of the community as a whole, which was a big thing for me in Chinatown.”
								<br> <br />
								Many college students who grew up in Chinatown were immigrants from China as well. Chinatown is important to immigrants who come from China because it gives them a place to feel at ease in a place that draws many parallels of the culture of their home country.  Over the past few years, Chinatown has gotten a lot more immigrants coming from mainland China.
								<br> <br />
								Willie Li, a sophomore student attending IIT, states: <br>
                                “China was actually the first place I lived before I came to America. Most of the experiences I had growing up in China was mostly positive. When my parents and I came here we were very lost and confused. We didn’t speak the language and we didn't understand what was going on. And in Chinatown we were able to see many of the same things we would see in China which made it easier to cope and understand and make our life better in America. It gave us a sense of comfort during our most difficult times.”
								<br> <br />
								A lot of students who grew up in Chinatown are Americanized due to living in the United states. Compared to first generation Chinese, many students are second generation students, and tradition is not as heavily emphasized. However, students who grew up in Chinatown are still regularly exposed to Chinese culture and tradition because of the many practice of tradition in Chinatown.  Elaina Yon, a junior at IIT states  “I think living in America makes you more Americanized too, but it doesn’t override Chinese heritage. Living in Chinatown allows you to see the people who are familiar with the tradition, and allows you to learn from it.”
                                <br> <br />
                                Growing up in Chinatown is a large part of the identity of Chinese students who lived or grew up there. Chinatown is a unifying community and is an integral part for maintaining culture and tradition for many Chinese people.

														<h1>广场舞</h1>
														<p>
								广场舞长期以来一直是中国的一个现象，他们作为一个集体的影响力正在中国居民聚集的地区，特别是在美国的中国城发酵。
								<br>
								“dama”一词大致翻译为“大妈”，指的是在城市广场或公园里跳舞，以极其嘈杂的音乐表演的中年妇女群体。在中国，damas的数量估计超过1亿，其中大部分年龄介于50至60岁之间。
								<br>
								许多学者追溯舞蹈到大妈们的童年时的亲和力，因为她们在文革期间成长。广场舞很快就风靡北京。那个时代的集体主义和社会和谐的概念反映在广场舞中，因为她们通过这么做获得安全感。
								<br>
								然而，其他不属于这一群体的人抱怨嘈杂的音乐和舞蹈，并说它会扰乱他们的注意力和日常生活。在广州，公民提出完全禁止广场舞，遭到来自大妈们的激烈抵抗。她们认为在公共场所跳舞并没有什么不妥，但批评者却说不然。
								<br>
								纽约的一个案例是，某个大妈根据城市规定，噪音水平太高而被捕，这有助于阐明双方的辩论。广场舞将何去何从，它的支持者和反对者又将如何？不管怎样，它现在确实存在。

								<h1>廣場舞</h1>
								<p>
								廣場舞長期以來一直是中國的一個現象，他們作為一個集體的影響力正在中國居民聚集的地區，特別是在美國的中國城發酵。
								<br>
								“dama”一詞大致翻譯為“大媽”，指的是在城市廣場或公園裡跳舞，以極其嘈雜的音樂表演的中年婦女群體。在中國，damas的數量估計超過1億，其中大部分年齡介於50至60歲之間。
								<br>
								許多學者追溯舞蹈到大媽們的童年時的親和力，因為她們在文革期間成長。廣場舞很快就風靡北京。那個時代的集體主義和社會和諧的概念反映在廣場舞中，因為她們通過這麼做獲得安全感。
								<br>
								然而，其他不屬於這一群體的人抱怨嘈雜的音樂和舞蹈，並說它會擾亂他們的注意力和日常生活。在廣州，公民提出完全禁止廣場舞，遭到來自大媽們的激烈抵抗。她們認為在公共場所跳舞並沒有什麼不妥，但批評者卻說不然。
								<br>
								紐約的一個案例是，某個大媽根據城市規定，噪音水平太高而被捕，這有助於闡明雙方的辯論。廣場舞將何去何從，它的支持者和反對者又將如何？不管怎樣，它現在確實存在。
