* TODO Map pins
** Some locations or content pages still don't have map pins
* TODO Improve readmore functionality
** Readmore should work without significantly impacting the structure of the HTML.
** Readmore should work across multiple paragraphs.
** Integrate with language functionality? Perhaps reconsider how languages are handled.
*** The alternative way to handle languages is to have a new path for each language.
**** www.example.com/en/foo and www.example.com/zh_HANS/foo
* TODO Clean up directory structure
** Many files are named inconsistently (foo-bar, fooBar, foo_bar). It could be a massive job to change them one by one.
** I like the foo-bar name scheme the most, then fooBar, then foo_bar. Using spaces in filenames is typically inadvisable.
** Try using the Unix/Linux "sed" utility to change the content of files. Renaming is no big issue.
* TODO Clean up HTML
** Hopefully somebody knows how to make HTML look nice, because it's a bit involved.
** There are a lot of <div>s which are not all necessary.
** There are some paragraphs merged needlessly into one "paragraph" in order to facilitate readmore. This is awful.
** There are alt texts in English for the Chinese language sections.
* TODO Unify data structures
** The locations data structure in "map.js" could be used across multiple scripts and even loaded separately.
** This would save a lot of trouble from changing information.
* TODO Mobile optimization
** We didn't get much chance to test things on mobile.
* TODO "Make it look nice"
** We all hate to hear this one, but work closely with people who understand design to make it happen.
* TODO Finalize audio/text content
** Some of the audio and text content is not there or not quite good enough.
* TODO NoJS warnings
** If you're going to use JavaScript, then you need to tell users that don't have it what's going on.
*** Use more <noscript> tags to explain what's going on to people without JavaScript
** My preference was to release my JavaScript into the Public Domain, as you can see on the map.js and language.js files.
*** This means that I have no copyright claims to my JavaScript. Otherwise, I might be able to legally claim that I own the JavaScript, and prevent you from using it.
